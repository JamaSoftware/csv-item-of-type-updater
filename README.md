# CSV Item Of Type Updater
The purpose of this script is to read in a csv file and process each row to update the corresponding item of type fields.

It parses a CSV file with a source and destination column. This script will then update each item specified in the CSV with the corresponding item of type value.Â 


# Source CSV Content
The source csv content must have a header row with two columns to represent a source ID and a destination ID. There can
be extra data in this CSV because the config file will require you to specify this source and destination CSV header names.
The content of the cells must me a unique Jama identifier (e.g. API ID, documentKey, globalId, a custom field). Using 
the API ID is the most ideal for script efficiency.

## Configuration
Before you can execute the script you must configure the script via a config file.  The config file is
structured in a standard .ini file format. there is an example config.ini file included with this repo that you
may modify with your settings.  I recommend that you create a copy of the template config file and rename it to
something that is meaningful for your execution.

* csv_destination_header: CSV header name for the destination column to map to. 

* using_api_id: boolean (e.g. true, false) if using a different identifier field, please ensure that the selected field
is unique across your Jama instance.
